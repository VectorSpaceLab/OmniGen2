I see that you want to push your local changes to GitHub.

Based on the `git status` you provided, it looks like you're in the middle of an interactive rebase that needs to be completed. Here's the plan:

1.  **Complete the rebase**: I'll run `git rebase --continue` to finalize the rebase operation.
2.  **Stage all changes**: You mentioned pushing *everything* local to the remote. To do that, I'll stage all your current unstaged and untracked files using `git add .`.
3.  **Commit the changes**: I'll commit the newly staged files with a message.
4.  **Push to remote**: Finally, I'll push all your committed changes to the `main` branch on your remote repository.

I will now start by completing the rebase.

```bash
git rebase --continue
```
